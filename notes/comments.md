# Comments

Here is a simple comment:

```rust
// hello, world
fn main() {
    // contents
}
```

For multi-line comments:

```rust
/*
    the function that follows requires a bit
    more explanation than a single-line
    comment could provide.
*/
fn main() {
    // contents
}
```

Inline-comments:

```rust
fn main() {
    let lucky: i32 = 7; // the lucky number
}
```

More common format:

```rust
fn main() {
    // the lucky number
    let lucky: i32 = 7;
}
```
